----------- Instructions -----------

Copied files to #{features_dir}.
You must manually merge files from

  features_template/step_definitions
  features_template/support

To your ./features dir.

If you haven't edited any of the files:

  features/support/env.rb
  features/support/hooks.rb
  features/step_definitions/ilesspainful_steps.rb

You can simply copy files from

  features_template/step_definitions
  features_template/support

to the corresponding dirs in features.
You must also delete: features/step_definitions/ilesspainful_steps.rb

Otherwise, if you have edited any of the files,
you must manually merge them with those of features_template.

It is important that you remove any reference to
the ilesspainfulclient-cucumber gem if present in your files.

When you are done, you should delete features_template.
